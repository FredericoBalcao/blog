Blog Student – PHP/MYSQL/HTML/CSS

This document aims to present a PHP programming language based on the WAMPSERVER 2.2 software, using phpMyAdmin, a web application developed in PHP for administration of MySQL over the Internet. From this system you can create and remove databases, create, remove and change tables, insert, remove and edit fields, execute SQL codes and manipulate key fields. PhpMyAdmin is widely used by web developers who often need to manipulate databases for the creation of their projects. Style languages ​​(CSS) were also used to define the presentation of the files and to provide a separation between the format and the content of each. In this way, a blog was created as a final project for the Web Programming and Database, with the purpose of being used by the students of the ESTGP computer courses, and of being a place of meeting and communication between old and future students.
